# Cooley's Percussion Inventory :drum:

## Description

This application allows the user to view all percussion instruments in Cooley's inventory (Display All Instruments Button). The instruments may also be filtered by category (Drums, Cymbals, Accessories). There is a button that clears all the instruments from the page.

There is a form that allows the user to add a new instrument to the inventory. The instrument with all it's attributes will be saved to the database and also be viewable on the webpage.
